# RTWSIOBP
RTWSIOBP or Remove Trailing WhiteSpace infront of Obsidian Bullet Point is made spesifically to help me copy and paste notes from Dicoding Platform

## The Problem
Dicoding platform often creates a bullet point that has multiple 'space' or whitespace infront of the bullet point and it really irritates me a lot

## The Solution
Since I'm taking notes right now with Obsidian, I follow the guide on how to make your own obsidian plugins with this [Obsidian Sample Plugin](https://github.com/obsidianmd/obsidian-sample-plugin).

## Do you need this plugin?
No, you don't need this plugin, unless youre a Mobile Development [Bangkit](https://grow.google/intl/id_id/bangkit/?tab=machine-learning) Student
